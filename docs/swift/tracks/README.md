# docs/swift/tracks/

A **track** is a named body of work tied to one or more related task IDs, owned
by a specific person or pair, with a designated RFC (or explicit "none") and a
single backlog file as source of truth. Track manifests give coordinators and AI
assistants a one-page picture without reading the full backlog.

## Rules for track manifests

1. One file per track, named `<ID>-<slug>.md`. Use the canonical ID from `id-legend.yaml`.
2. Maximum 80 lines per manifest.
3. Every ID referenced must exist in `docs/swift/data/id-legend.yaml`. Do not invent IDs.
4. The RFC link must point to an actual file in `docs/swift/rfc/`. If none, say "none — mechanical".
5. The backlog link must point to an actual section in a backlog file under `docs/swift/backlog/`.
6. Do not duplicate spec content — link to the RFC and backlog instead.
7. Status must match `id-legend.yaml`. Update both files together.
