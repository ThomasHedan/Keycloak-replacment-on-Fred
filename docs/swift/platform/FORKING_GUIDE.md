# Forking Fred — The Right Way

This guide is for teams that deploy Fred under their own branding or with organisation-specific content (legal notices, agents, release notes). It defines the one rule that keeps your fork permanently merge-compatible with the open source `develop` branch.

---

## The cardinal rule

> **A fork must never modify a source code file.**
> Only files under `apps/frontend/public/contrib/<your-brand>/` may be fork-specific.

If this rule is followed, every future `git merge develop` from the open source repository is conflict-free on all code files — forever. Conflicts become structurally impossible.

If this rule is broken, every merge becomes a manual conflict resolution exercise. Over time the fork drifts, the team stops merging, and the fork becomes an unmaintained dead-end.

---

## The `contrib/` mechanism

Fred's frontend resolves content files through a brand-aware cascade. Set your brand name once in `apps/frontend/public/config.json`:

```json
{
  "frontend_basename": "/",
  "releaseBrand": "acme"
}
```

From that point on, every content-aware page tries your brand files first and falls back to the open source defaults:

### Legal pages (substitutive — your file replaces the default)

| Priority | Path tried               | Wins when                    |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1        | `contrib/acme/gcu.fr.md` | User language is French      |
| 2        | `contrib/acme/gcu.md`    | Any language, brand fallback |
| 3        | `gcu.fr.md`              | No brand file, French        |
| 4        | `gcu.md`                 | Final fallback               |

Same cascade applies to `gdpr.*.md`.

### Release notes (additive — your file is shown alongside the base)

| File                      | Shown as                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `/release.md`             | "Base Fred Release" tab |
| `contrib/acme/release.md` | "acme release" tab      |

Both tabs are displayed simultaneously. This is intentional: your release notes document your brand-specific additions; the base notes document the open source changes underneath.

## What belongs in `contrib/<your-brand>/`

```
apps/frontend/public/contrib/acme/
├── gcu.md              # Terms of use — English
├── gcu.fr.md           # Terms of use — French
├── gdpr.md             # Privacy notice — English
├── gdpr.fr.md          # Privacy notice — French
└── release.md          # Brand-specific release notes
```

These files are committed in your fork's git repository. The open source repository never touches the `contrib/` directory. Your files are never in conflict.

Do not put anything else in your fork's `src/` tree. If you find yourself needing to modify a `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.scss`, or translation `.json` file, stop — this is a signal that the open source codebase is missing a configuration or extension point. Open an issue or a pull request upstream instead.

---

## Meridian (1.5.x) — legacy intermediate state

In the Meridian release line, some teams placed organisation-specific agent code directly inside the fork's `agentic-backend/` source tree. This was unavoidable at the time: Fred did not yet ship a clean agent extension mechanism.

This was a known limitation, not an intended pattern.

---

## Current architecture (2.x) — independent agent pods

Fred now ships the clean agent extension mechanism that Meridian lacked. **You no longer put agent code inside the Fred source tree at all.**

Instead:

- **Build your agents as an independent pod** using `fred-sdk` + `fred-runtime`. See [fred-samples](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/fred-samples) for a reference implementation.
- Your pod lives in its own repository, has its own release cycle and image, and registers itself with the control plane.
- The Fred core repository becomes a pure dependency — you consume it, you never patch it.
- Merging upstream Fred updates requires zero conflict resolution on any source file.

If your fork still has agent code inside `agentic-backend/`, the migration path is:

1. Extract the agent code into its own repository as a `fred-runtime`-based pod.
2. Register the pod with the control plane (see `apps/fred-agents/` for the wiring pattern).
3. Remove the agent code from your Fred fork.

**The `contrib/` pattern described in this guide remains valid for frontend static content** (legal notices, release notes). Brand-specific static assets continue to live under `apps/frontend/public/contrib/<your-brand>/` with no conflict risk.

---

## Merge workflow for fork maintainers

Once your fork follows the rules above, the full synchronisation workflow is:

```bash
# On your fork's integration branch
git merge develop

# Expected result: no conflicts on any source file.
# Your contrib/ files are untouched.
# Review, test, and promote to your production branch as usual.
```

If you encounter a conflict on a source file, treat it as a bug — either in your fork (a code override that should not exist) or in the open source codebase (a missing extension point). Do not resolve it silently; fix the root cause.

## Checklist before your first clean merge

- [ ] `apps/frontend/public/config.json` has `"releaseBrand": "<your-brand>"`
- [ ] Legal content is in `apps/frontend/public/contrib/<your-brand>/gcu.md` (and language variants)
- [ ] Privacy notice is in `apps/frontend/public/contrib/<your-brand>/gdpr.md`
- [ ] Brand release notes (if any) are in `apps/frontend/public/contrib/<your-brand>/release.md`
- [ ] No `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.scss`, or `.json` file from `src/` exists in your fork's overlay
- [ ] Agent code (Meridian only) is isolated under `contrib/<your-brand>/` and registered via Helm, not via source patches
- [ ] `git merge develop` runs with zero conflicts
