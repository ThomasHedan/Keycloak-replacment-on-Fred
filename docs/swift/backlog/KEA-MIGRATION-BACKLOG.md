# Kea→Swift Migration Backlog

Epic: **MIGR-00** — Kea→Swift production cutover

This backlog tracks the three workstreams needed to cut over from Kea (production) to
Swift (new architecture). Owner of each sub-item = the person doing the work.
Set `owner:` in `id-legend.yaml` when a ticket is picked up.

## §1 Cherry-picks and code adaptations (MIGR-01)

Commits or features from the Kea codebase that need to be cherry-picked or
re-implemented for Swift. For each item, note the source commit/PR and what
adaptation is needed (e.g. API contract change, dependency replacement).

Legend: **[needed]** = blocking for production cutover · **[good-to-have]** = quality / dev-experience

## §2 Postgres data/schema migration and backfill scripts for Fred tables(MIGR-02)

Schema diffs and backfill scripts for existing production data.
Each row represents one backfill script or migration step.

### Required

- [ ] **MIGR-02.01** — Cherry-pick `created_at` / `updated_at` timestamps on all ORM tables
  — *Prerequisite for KPI queries on production data*
  — depends on: MIGR-01.04 (same commit, must land first)

- [ ] **MIGR-02.02** — Backfill script: migrate data from `agent` → `agent_instance`, then drop `agent`
  — *`agent` table is the Kea model; Swift uses `agent_instance` — production data must be migrated before cutover*

### Optional

- [ ] **MIGR-02.03** — Backfill script: migrate conversations from `session` → `session_metadata`
  — *Table rename between Kea and Swift; existing sessions would be lost without this*

- [ ] **MIGR-02.04** — Handle `session_history` schema change
  — *Schema differs between Kea and Swift; assess: migrate in place, transform, or accept history loss*

---

## §3 Feature parity — Kea features missing in Swift (MIGR-03)

Features present in Kea production that are not yet in Swift.
For each item: assess whether to port as-is, adapt to Swift architecture, or drop
with a written rationale.

- [ ] **MIGR-03.01** — Session attachments — add document to a conversation directly
  — *Users could attach documents inline in a chat session in Kea*

- [ ] **MIGR-03.02** — Message feedback — leave a rating with 5 stars and a comment on a chat message
  — *Feedback feature was available in Kea; used for quality monitoring*

- [ ] **MIGR-03.03** — Source citation in chat — display source references alongside agent responses
  — *Kea showed which documents/sources were used in the response*
