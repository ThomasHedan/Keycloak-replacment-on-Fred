ReAct RAG MCP template — document-grounded agent via Knowledge Flow MCP search.

Why this module exists:
- complements rico (rag_expert) which uses the fred built-in knowledge.search
  tool ref; this template wires document retrieval through the MCP layer instead
- allows admins to configure library selection, search policy, and RAG scope
  directly from the Tools tab in the agent creation form
- serves as the canonical template when an operator wants a user-named,
  MCP-backed document search agent

Key design:
- declares MCP_SERVER_KNOWLEDGE_FLOW_TEXT in default_mcp_servers so the runtime
  and control-plane surface the server in the Tools tab with its config_fields
  (library picker, search policy, RAG scope)
- the agent name is set by the operator at enrollment time via the form's
  displayName field — no FieldSpec needed for that
- system prompt is the same grounding contract as rico: evidence-first,
  explicit uncertainty, language-aware

How to use it:
- import REACT_RAG_MCP_AGENT and add it to the pod registry
- operators create a named instance from the control-plane team agents page,
  pick a name, and configure the Tools tab

Example:
- `from fred_agents.react_rag_mcp import REACT_RAG_MCP_AGENT`

    Document-grounded ReAct agent template backed by Knowledge Flow MCP search.

    Why this class exists:
    - provides a user-nameable template for operators who want document search
      via the MCP layer rather than the fred built-in knowledge.search tool ref
    - the Tools tab exposes library selection, search policy, and RAG scope
      because the MCP server declares those config_fields in mcp_catalog.yaml
    - keeps grounding behaviour identical to rico: evidence-first, explicit
      uncertainty, language-aware

    Key design choices:
    - default_mcp_servers points to the text-search Knowledge Flow endpoint;
      the control-plane enriches the template summary with the server's
      config_fields so they appear in the Tools tab at enrollment time
    - one prompts.system FieldSpec lets operators specialise the instructions
      without forking the template

    How to use it:
    - instantiate once and register in the pod registry
    - operators create a named instance via the control-plane team agents page

    Example:
    - `definition = ReactRagMcpDefinition()`
