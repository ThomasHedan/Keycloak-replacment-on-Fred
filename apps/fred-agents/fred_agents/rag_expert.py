Standalone RAG Expert ReAct agent definition.

Why this module exists:
- it ports the RAG Expert business profile into a direct `fred-sdk` definition
  that the standalone pod can serve without depending on agentic-backend
- it is a reference example of a Fred agent that relies on a first-class
  platform tool ref (`knowledge.search`) rather than an MCP server

How to use it:
- import `RAG_EXPERT_AGENT` and add it to a pod registry
- keep the prompt in `prompts/basic_react_rag_expert_system_prompt.md`

Example:
- `from fred_agents.rag_expert import RAG_EXPERT_AGENT`

class RagExpertReActDefinition(ReActAgentDefinition):
    """
    Document-grounded ReAct agent served by the standalone agents pod.

    Why this class exists:
    - it provides a production-quality RAG assistant that grounds every answer
      in evidence retrieved from the user-selected document corpus
    - it demonstrates the `declared_tool_refs` pattern (first-class Fred platform
      tools) as opposed to the `default_mcp_servers` pattern (external MCP servers)

    Key design choices:
    - `declared_tool_refs` declares `knowledge.search` — the Fred built-in
      retrieval tool — so the runtime can bind it at execution time
    - guardrails are kept inside `policy()`, not on the class, because they are
      operating constraints that the runtime enforces, not authoring metadata
    - no MCP servers are declared: RAG grounding is a Fred first-class concern

    How to use it:
    - instantiate it once and register it in the pod registry
    - extend `declared_tool_refs` if additional retrieval tools are introduced

    Example:
    - `definition = RagExpertReActDefinition()`

        Return the RAG Expert conversational policy for the ReAct runtime.

        Why this function exists:
        - `ReActRuntime` drives standalone pod agents through a pure `ReActPolicy`
        - guardrails are declared here because they are runtime operating
          constraints, not agent authoring metadata

        How to use it:
        - call indirectly through `ReActRuntime`; authors set class fields and
          keep this method focused on policy assembly
