Standalone Sentinel ReAct agent definition.

Why this module exists:
- it ports the existing Sentinel Basic ReAct business profile into a direct
  `fred-sdk` definition that a standalone pod can serve
- it avoids depending on `agentic-backend` profile-discovery code for this
  first SDK extraction exercise

How to use it:
- import `SENTINEL_AGENT` and add it to a pod registry
- keep the prompt in `prompts/basic_react_sentinel_system_prompt.md`

Example:
- `from fred_agents.sentinel.profile import SENTINEL_AGENT`
"""

    MCP_SERVER_KNOWLEDGE_FLOW_OPENSEARCH_OPS,

from fred_sdk.resources import load_agent_prompt_markdown


class SentinelReActDefinition(ReActAgentDefinition):
    """
    Monitoring-focused ReAct agent served by the standalone agents pod.

    Why this class exists:
    - it gives the new pod one real production-style agent to validate the
      public `fred-sdk` and `fred-runtime` contracts
    - it preserves the business intent of the legacy Sentinel profile while
      removing the backend-only profile layer from this first migration step

    How to use it:
    - instantiate it once and register it in the pod registry
    - extend it later if Sentinel needs additional declared tools or guardrails

    Example:
    - `definition = SentinelReActDefinition()`

    def policy(self) -> ReActPolicy:
        """
        Return the Sentinel conversational policy for the ReAct runtime.

        Why this function exists:
        - `ReActRuntime` executes standalone pod agents through a pure
          `ReActPolicy`
        - Sentinel currently only needs its system prompt and default MCP
          servers to behave like the backend profile

        How to use it:
        - call indirectly through `ReActRuntime`; authors normally just set the
          class fields and keep this method minimal

        Example:
        - `policy = SentinelReActDefinition().policy()`
        """
