## Summary (how to choose)

- **Hybrid (default)** — _AI + keywords_  
  Balanced results that work well for most queries. Great when your question mixes natural language with **specific
  tokens** (IDs, error codes, config keys).  
  ➜ If the backend has no keyword index, Hybrid gracefully falls back to Semantic behavior.

- **Semantic** — _AI only (fast)_  
  Best for **concept exploration** and paraphrased questions. Lowest latency and simplest setup.  
  Not ideal when you must match **exact tokens** or phrases.

- **Strict** — _precision-first_  
  Shows results **only** when both AI similarity and keyword evidence (and optionally an exact phrase) agree.  
  Great for **compliance**, **policy lookups**, and **change control**. May return **no results** by design. Requires
  keyword/phrase support.

| Mode         | Best for                                          | Trade-off                     | Needs keyword index?              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Hybrid**   | Everyday use, mixed queries                       | Slightly slower than AI-only  | Optional (uses it when available) |
| **Semantic** | Conceptual / exploratory questions                | May miss exact tokens         | No                                |
| **Strict**   | Compliance, exact tokens, low tolerance for noise | Fewer results, sometimes none | **Yes**                           |
