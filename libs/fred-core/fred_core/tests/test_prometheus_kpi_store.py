Tests for PrometheusKPIStore label cardinality and dimension handling.

Ref: docs/WORKPLAN.md S2 — Prometheus cardinality fix: session_id and user_id
     removed from label dimensions; turn-level KPI quantities (tool_count,
     input_tokens, output_tokens) now captured correctly.

    Ensure Prometheus labels stay low-cardinality without losing structured dims.

    Why this exists:
    - runtime tool and graph KPI events carry `session_id`, `user_id`, and
      `exchange_id`, but those fields must not become Prometheus label series.

    How to use it:
    - run in the default offline `fred-core` test suite.

    Example:
    - `pytest fred_core/tests/test_prometheus_kpi_store.py -q`
