"""
Offline unit tests for fred_core.kpi.noop_kpi_writer.NoOpKPIWriter.

The NoOp writer is used in every unit and integration test that instruments
code with the KPI API. If its contract is broken (timer doesn't yield a
mutable Dims dict, timed() fails to call the function, etc.) every caller
silently misbehaves.

Focus: verify the contract is honoured, not that operations do nothing.
