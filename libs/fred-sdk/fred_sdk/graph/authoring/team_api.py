TeamAgent authoring primitives for multi-agent coordination.

Why this module exists:
- building multi-agent teams in fred v2 currently requires writing explicit
  graph nodes, edges, and state schemas for every team composition
- this module provides a higher-level abstraction: declare team members with
  their roles and instructions, and let the framework generate the workflow
- the API mirrors the simplicity of team frameworks such as agno: describe
  who is on the team and what they do, then run

Who this module is for:
- agent authors who want to compose specialized agents into a coordinated team
- this is part of the public authoring surface and is designed to be
  pip-installable as a standalone SDK in a future extraction step

SDK extraction note:
- this module depends only on the graph authoring layer (`api.py`) and the
  graph runtime context; it does NOT import runtime internals or Fred platform
  specifics beyond what any graph agent already uses
- when the authoring surface is extracted to a standalone package, this module
  moves with it unchanged

Modes:
- ``sequential`` (default): members run in declaration order; each member is an
  inline LLM call using its ``instructions``; no coordinator LLM is involved,
  making this the cheapest and most deterministic option
- ``dynamic``: a coordinator LLM runs after each member and decides who works
  next, allowing adaptive delegation and early stopping; members are inline LLM
  calls
- ``route``: a coordinator LLM picks exactly one registered agent and delegates
  the full request to it via ``context.invoke_agent``; every ``AgentSpec`` must
  declare an ``agent_ref`` pointing to a registered fred agent; the selected
  agent runs as a real independent agent (with its own tools, prompts, memory)
  rather than as an inline LLM call

Member kinds:

``AgentSpec(name, role, instructions)``
    Inline LLM call.  Used in ``sequential`` and ``dynamic`` modes.  The member
    receives the task plus prior context and produces text output.

``AgentSpec(name, role, agent_ref="v2.my.agent")``
    Real agent invocation.  Required in ``route`` mode; also usable in
    ``sequential`` and ``dynamic`` to delegate a step to a registered agent
    rather than an ad-hoc LLM call.

Example (sequential pipeline with inline members)::

    class CandidateScreeningTeam(TeamAgent):
        agent_id = "sample.candidate_screening_team"
        role = "Screen job candidates through a multi-stage pipeline"
        description = "Parse, match, evaluate, and score each candidate"
        tags = ("team", "screening", "hr")

        members = (
            AgentSpec(
                name="Resume Parser",
                role="Extract structured data from the resume",
                instructions="Parse the resume and output JSON with name, skills, years of experience...",
            ),
            AgentSpec(
                name="Skills Matcher",
                role="Match candidate skills to the job requirements",
                instructions="Compare the parsed skills against requirements and score the match 0-100...",
            ),
        )

Example (route to a registered agent)::

    class SupportRouter(TeamAgent):
        agent_id = "support.router"
        role = "Route support requests to the right specialist agent"
        description = "Reads the request and delegates to the best registered agent"
        tags = ("router", "support")
        mode = "route"
        coordinator_instructions = (
            "You are a support dispatcher.  Read the request and choose the single "
            "most appropriate specialist.  Never try to handle it yourself."
        )

        members = (
            AgentSpec(
                name="Billing Agent",
                role="Handles billing, invoices, and payment questions",
                agent_ref="v2.production.billing_agent",
            ),
            AgentSpec(
                name="Technical Agent",
                role="Handles technical issues, bugs, and configuration",
                agent_ref="v2.production.technical_agent",
            ),
        )

Example (dynamic coordinator with inline members)::

    class ResearchTeam(TeamAgent):
        agent_id = "sample.research_team"
        role = "Research a topic using a flexible team"
        description = "Coordinator routes to the right specialist based on what is still missing"
        tags = ("team", "research")
        mode = "dynamic"
        coordinator_instructions = "Assemble a complete research report. Use the researcher for facts, the writer to synthesize."

        members = (
            AgentSpec(name="Researcher", role="Gather facts and sources", instructions="..."),
            AgentSpec(name="Writer", role="Synthesize into a readable report", instructions="..."),

    Declarative description of one team member.

    Why this model exists:
    - authors should describe each specialist in one place without writing
      explicit graph nodes, state updates, or LangGraph wiring
    - this is the fred v2 equivalent of agno's ``Agent(name=, role=, instructions=)``

    How to use it:

    Inline LLM member (used in ``sequential`` and ``dynamic`` modes):

    - set ``name`` to a short human-readable identifier
    - set ``role`` to one sentence describing what this member specialises in
    - set ``instructions`` to the full system prompt the member LLM will receive

    Real agent member (required in ``route`` mode, also usable in other modes):

    - set ``agent_ref`` to the ``agent_id`` of a registered fred agent
    - ``instructions`` is ignored when ``agent_ref`` is set; the registered
      agent runs with its own configured prompts and tools

    Example (inline LLM member)::

        AgentSpec(
            name="Technical Writer",
            role="Synthesise all research into a polished blog post",
            instructions="You are a senior technical writer. Use all provided research...",

class TeamAgent(GraphAgent):
    """
    Authoring base class for multi-agent teams.

    Why this class exists:
    - coordinating a group of specialised agents requires graph nodes, state
      schemas, and routing wiring that repeats across every team composition
    - ``TeamAgent`` removes that ceremony: declare members, pick a mode, run

    How to use it:
    - subclass ``TeamAgent`` and set ``agent_id``, ``role``, ``description``,
      ``tags``, and ``members``
    - optionally set ``mode`` (default ``"sequential"``) and
      ``coordinator_instructions`` (required when ``mode == "dynamic"``)
    - the framework generates ``input_schema``, ``state_schema``, ``workflow``,
      and ``input_to_state`` automatically from the member declarations
    - do NOT declare these class variables manually on a ``TeamAgent`` subclass

    Modes:

    ``sequential`` (default)
        Members run in declaration order. Every member receives the original
        task plus all prior member outputs. No coordinator LLM call is made
        between members, making this the cheapest and most predictable option.
        Ideal for ordered pipelines such as parse → evaluate → score.

    ``dynamic``
        A coordinator LLM runs after each member and decides who works next
        (or declares the task done). Set ``coordinator_instructions`` to guide
        the coordinator's strategy. Ideal when the order depends on the task.

    SDK extraction note:
        This class belongs to the public authoring surface. It does not import
        Fred platform internals and is safe to move to a standalone SDK package.

    Example (sequential pipeline)::

        class CandidateScreeningTeam(TeamAgent):
            agent_id = "sample.candidate_screening_team"
            role = "Screen candidates through a four-stage pipeline"
            description = "Parse, match, evaluate, then score each candidate"
            tags = ("team", "hr", "screening")

            members = (
                AgentSpec(
                    name="Resume Parser",
                    role="Extract structured data from the resume",
                    instructions="Parse the resume and return JSON...",
                ),
                AgentSpec(
                    name="Scorer",
                    role="Produce a final recommendation",
                    instructions="Use the previous analysis to score the candidate...",
                ),
            )

    Example (dynamic coordinator)::

        class TechBlogTeam(TeamAgent):
            agent_id = "sample.techblog_team"
            role = "Write technical blog posts"
            description = "Research, generate examples, then write the post"
            tags = ("team", "writing")
            mode = "dynamic"
            coordinator_instructions = "Produce a complete, publication-ready blog post."

            members = (
                AgentSpec(name="Researcher", role="Find facts and examples", instructions="..."),
