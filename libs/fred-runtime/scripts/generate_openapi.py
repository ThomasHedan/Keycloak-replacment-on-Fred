"""
Generate the frontend-facing fred-runtime OpenAPI specification offline.

Why this exists:
- `fred-runtime` is a reusable library, not a standalone backend with its own
  `main.py` and checked-in config directory
- Phase 2 frontend codegen still needs a stable `openapi.json` artifact sourced
  from the runtime execution contracts

How to use it:
- run `make generate-openapi` from `libs/fred-runtime`
- the script builds a minimal offline pod app and writes `openapi.json` at the
  library root

Example:
- `cd libs/fred-runtime && make generate-openapi`

    Build a minimal offline pod app used only for OpenAPI export.

    Why this exists:
    - the runtime contracts live on the reusable pod routes created by

    - schema export should not depend on a real agent registry, Keycloak, or
      external services being available

    How to use it:
    - call once during schema generation, then use `app.openapi()`
