# Developer Tools – AI-Assisted Review & Compliance

This folder provides AI-powered developer utilities to improve code quality and deployment consistency for the [Fred](https://fredk8.dev) project. It also includes a license header enforcement script.

> ⚠️ **Notice**:  
> These tools require an OpenAI API key to function.  
> Create a file at `config/.env` with the following content:
>
> ```env
> OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
> ```
>
> Currently, **only OpenAI** is supported as a provider. However, this is a temporary limitation — the Fred backend already includes rich support for other providers (Azure, Ollama, etc.). These tools are designed first as minimal standalone utilities. Later, they may be integrated as Fred agents or LangGraph flows, once their usage patterns and value are validated.

## 📦 1. `ai_code_review.py` — Python Code Quality Review

This script reviews your local Python changes using GPT-4 and provides actionable feedback based on internal coding standards.

### Features

- Checks for:
  - Violations of architecture (services, controllers, utils)
  - Bad exception handling or missing validations
  - Lack of tests or docstrings
  - Poor naming or misuse of Pydantic
- References:
  - `docs/CODING_GUIDELINES.md`
  - `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`

### Usage

Run via Make:

```bash
make review-pull-request   # Review committed changes vs origin/main
make review-uncommitted    # Review staged changes
make review-all            # Review all modified Python files
```

---

## 🔧 2. `ai_deployment_review.py` — Deployment Consistency Review

Checks whether Python config model changes (e.g., `BaseModel` fields) are reflected in the deployment configuration (Helm, YAML, etc).

### Features

- Detects renamed/missing fields between Python and deployment files
- Highlights obsolete or unreferenced fields in Helm charts
- Uses vector search and GPT to contextualize changes

### Usage

```bash
make review-deploy
```

This helps bridge the gap between developers and DevOps engineers by catching mismatches **before** they cause runtime issues.

## 🪪 3. `check_and_add_apachev2_headers.sh` — License Header Checker

Ensures all Python files include the required [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) header.

### Usage

```bash
./check_and_add_apachev2_headers.sh
```

- Scans all `.py` files under the current folder
- Skips `.venv`, `.git`, `__pycache__`, and `htmlcov`
- Prepends the license header if missing

---

## 🛠️ Setup

Install dependencies with:

```bash
make dev
```

Create a `.env` file under `config/`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup

Remove the virtual environment and build artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

---

## 🧭 Notes

- These tools are designed to run **from the `developer_tools/` folder**.
- `Makefile` targets handle virtualenv activation and path configuration.
- All prompts and responses use OpenAI's GPT models with structured input for consistent results.
- These utilities are intentionally implemented as **minimal, decoupled apps** rather than Fred agents. This avoids bootstrapping complexity and keeps experimentation simple. Later, once their usefulness is proven, they may be integrated into Fred’s agentic architecture.
